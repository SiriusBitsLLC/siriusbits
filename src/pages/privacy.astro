        </li>
        <li>
          Usage data collected automatically (such as pages visited, referring URLs,
          browser and device information, and approximate location derived from IP
          address). This helps us improve the site and understand interest in our
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cookies and similar technologies used for essential site functionality and
