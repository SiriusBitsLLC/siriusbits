# First prompt

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

I want to build a website that will be used to manage my consulting practice - SiriusBits. The website domain is <www.siriusbits.com>. I will include and showcase projects and include multiple ways to contact me (contact form, chatbot, email, phone number). I want to be able to add to my portfolio of projects and feature work I have done. I want to also have a blog where I can write about my experiences and share my knowledge. I need a SiriusBits uses section to include info on the my gear and setup. I want a section on the types of consulting work I do.

The design will be simple and clean. I want it to be easy to navigate and use. I want it to be responsive and mobile-friendly. I want it to be fast and secure. I want it to be easy to update and maintain. I want it to be easy to scale and grow.

## Finally

Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.
